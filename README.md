## Introduction
Using artificial intelligence it is possible to clone a voice/synthetic voice of a real person which will have the same tone, voice and likeliness with a great accuracy. Using it we can generate whole sentences, which can be used for malicious intentions. This is done by feeding a data containing the voice of that person also called as training data and the computer will generate a model to mimic the voice of that person. The more the training data is provided more will be the accuracy with which the model will mimic the voice. This speech generated is called as fake speech.

## About the project
Our job is to detect fake speech of given audio file, so we are using openSMILE features, which are extracted from given audio file. Based on these features we have to detect whether the speech is real or fake using machine learning models such as:
* Random forest
* Decision tree
* Support vector machine
* Logistic regression


## Built with
All the code is written in Python3 and Jupyter Notebook.
