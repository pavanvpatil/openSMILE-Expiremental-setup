    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Using artificial intelligence it is possible to clone a voice/synthetic voice of a real
        person which will have the same tone, voice and likeliness with a great accuracy.
        Using it we can generate whole sentences, which can be used for malicious in-
        tentions. This is done by feeding a data containing the voice of that person also
        called as training data and the computer will generate a model to mimic the
        voice of that person. The more the training data is provided more will be the
        accuracy with which the model will mimic the voice. This speech generated is
        called as fake speech.

    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>Our job is to detect fake speech of given audio file,
        so we are using openSMILE features, which are extracted from given audio file.
        Based on these features we have to detect whether the speech is real or fake using machine
        learning models such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Random forest</li>
            <li>Decision tree</li>
            <li>Support vector machine</li>
            <li>Logistic regression</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Built with</h2>
    All the code is written in Python3 and Jupyter Notebook.
